# Kaggle notebooks

These are notebooks I'm working through that detail some of the more basic machine learning techniques in sklearn. 

Of particular note (as of Jan 27, 2024) is the Pipelines notebook, which details how to use sklearn's Pipeline class to chain together multiple transformers and estimators into a single object. This is useful for a number of reasons, but primarily because it allows you to treat the entire pipeline as a single estimator, making the code super clean!!!
